## Hibernate

Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. In Spring Boot, Hibernate simplifies the interaction with relational databases by mapping Java classes to database tables. It handles database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records without requiring extensive SQL code, thereby streamlining data persistence and retrieval processes within a Spring Boot application.

## JPA

Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It defines a set of concepts and APIs for object-relational mapping, enabling developers to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. JPA provides a standard for ORM, and frameworks like Hibernate implement this specification. In a Spring Boot application, JPA allows for database operations to be performed in a consistent and standardized manner, making it easier to work with relational data.
