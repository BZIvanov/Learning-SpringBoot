# Custom form validation

## Custom annotation

In Java, the @interface keyword is used to define a custom annotation.

### How @interface Works

- When you declare an annotation using `@interface`, Java treats it as a special type of interface.
- Annotations can be used to provide metadata about code (like `@Override`, `@RestController`, etc.).
- They don't have method bodies; instead, they define elements (fields) with default values or required inputs.
