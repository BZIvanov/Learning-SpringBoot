# Beans

Read [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html) the official docs.

## @Configuration

- **Purpose** - Marks a class as a configuration class that defines Spring beans
- **How it works** - Classes annotated with `@Configuration` are processed by Spring, and methods inside them annotated with `@Bean` define beans.
- **Use Case** - When you need to explicitly declare and configure beans in a centralized manner

## @Bean

`@Bean` is an annotation used to indicate that a method will return an object that should be registered as a Spring Bean in the application context. It is typically used within a `@Configuration`-annotated class to define and configure beans programmatically.

When we create a Java object using the `new` operator directly, the Spring Context (Spring IoC Container) **won't be aware** of its existence. However, when we annotate a method with `@Bean` inside a `@Configuration` class, we are explicitly registering the object in the Spring IoC Container, allowing Spring to manage it as a bean.

### When to Use?

- when you need to register beans that are not part of your application‚Äôs source code
- when you want more control over the instantiation logic
- when component scanning (`@Component`) is not possible or practical

### Example

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    // Bean named name, it is using the method name by default
    @Bean
    public String name() {
        return "John";
    }

    @Bean
    public Integer age() { // do not use primitives like int here to ensure proper beans management
        return 27;
    }

    // Let Spring inject name and age
    @Bean
    public Person myFirstPerson(String name, int age) {
        return new Person(name, age);
    }

    // Bean with custom name
    @Bean("johnDoe")
    public Person mySecondPerson() {
        return new Person("John", 30);
    }
}
```

| **Definition**           | A reusable Java object following specific conventions.                                                               | An object managed by the Spring Container.                             |
| **Requirements**         | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Public no-arg constructor. <br> 2Ô∏è‚É£ Private fields with public getters & setters. <br> 3Ô∏è‚É£ Serializable (optional). | No strict rules‚Äîjust an object registered in the Spring IoC container. |
| **Management**           | Manually created using `new ClassName()` in Java.                                                                    | Created & managed by Spring (`@Component`, `@Bean`, etc.).             |
| **Dependency Injection** | No built-in DI support‚Äîmanual wiring.                                                                                | Supports DI via Spring.                                                |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Created & destroyed by the developer.                                                                                | Spring handles creation, initialization, and destruction.              |

## Additional annotations info

### @Lazy annotation

`@Lazy` annotation is used to indicate that a bean should be lazily initialized. This means that the bean will not be created and initialized until it is actually needed.

By default, Spring creates and initializes all singleton beans eagerly when the application context is started. You can change this behavior by marking a specific bean with the `@Lazy` annotation.

We can also apply the lazy globally.
