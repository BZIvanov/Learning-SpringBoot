# Gradle

Gradle is a **build automation tool** used primarily for **Java, Kotlin, and Groovy** projects. It is the default build system for Android and is widely used in Spring Boot applications.

It is an alternative to Maven, offering:

- Faster builds with incremental compilation.
- Declarative and flexible build scripts using Groovy or Kotlin DSL.
- Dependency management similar to Maven but more efficient.

## Maven vs. Gradle

- **Simplicity & Readability (XML Over DSL)**
  - **Maven uses XML** (`pom.xml`), which is more structured and readable for teams unfamiliar with Groovy/Kotlin DSL.
  - **Gradle uses Groovy/Kotlin DSL**, which can be more flexible but harder for beginners to read and debug.
- **Convention Over Configuration**
  - Maven follows strict conventions (e.g., predefined project structure, lifecycle).
  - Gradle is more flexible, but this can lead to inconsistent build scripts across teams.
- **More Built-in Features, Less Customization Required**
  - Maven has built-in dependency management and lifecycle phases (`compile`, `test`, `package`, etc.).
  - Gradle requires custom scripting for similar behavior.
- **Larger Community & Documentation**
  - Since Maven is older, it has better documentation and more StackOverflow answers.
  - Many third-party libraries, tools, and frameworks officially support Maven first.
