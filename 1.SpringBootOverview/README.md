# Spring Boot overview

Contains the very basics of Spring Boot.

## Starting new Spring Boot project

Visit this [link](https://start.spring.io/) to configure your new project and download the starter files as a zip from where you can continue building your project.

## Maven

Maven is a build automation and project management tool used primarily for Java projects, including Spring Boot applications. Maven helps manage project dependencies, compile and package the application, and handle other tasks such as running tests and deploying the application.

Maven is similar to NPM for Node.js. They both serve similar purposes in their respective ecosystems, managing dependencies, automating tasks, and maintaining project configurations to streamline the development process.

### Maven and IntelliJ

On the right-hand side vertical menu you can see the Maven icon.

You have ready to use actions, for example _Maven > project-name-here > Lifecycle > clean_.

## Code structure

Read the [docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/structuring-your-code.html) on recommended app code structure.
