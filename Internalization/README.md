# Internalization

Internationalization (**i18n**) allows an application to support **multiple languages** by dynamically loading localized messages from properties files.

Spring Boot provides built-in support for **i18n** using:

- `MessageSource` for message translations.
- `LocaleResolver` for detecting the userâ€™s preferred language.
