# Before Aspect Demo

To test this demo follow the comments and apply some comment/uncomment changes to the class `MyDemoLoggingAspect`.

## Missing folder/files

For simplicity the following folders/files were removed:

- .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
- src/test/java/com/example/aopdemo/AopdemoApplicationTests.java
- mvnw
- mvnw.cmd

They don't contain any changes from the default ones so you can just generate them with the Spring Initializr.
