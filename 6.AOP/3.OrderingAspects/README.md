# Ordering aspects

@Order annotation is used to define the sorting order of components, such as aspects or filters, within the application context. It allows you to specify the precedence of these components when multiple components of the same type are present. A lower value means higher priority.

## Missing folder/files

For simplicity the following folders/files were removed:

- .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
- src/test/java/com/example/aopdemo/AopdemoApplicationTests.java
- mvnw
- mvnw.cmd

They don't contain any changes from the default ones so you can just generate them with the Spring Initializr.
