# Logging

Logging is essential in any Spring Boot application for debugging and monitoring.

## Logback

Logback is the **default logging framework** in Spring Boot. It is the successor to **Log4j** and provides better performance, flexibility, and ease of configuration.

### Logback configuration

Spring Boot automatically loads Logback without needing extra dependencies. You can configure Logback using `application.properties` or `logback-spring.xml`.
